# rwsh - Roblox Wine wrapper in SHell

## running rwsh
in order to use rwsh you need to have the XDG utilities and wine.
```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wael444/rwsh/main/rwsh
```
this will pull the `rwsh` script into the current working directory.
it is reccomended to put this in your `PATH` (eg. `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)

## features
+ install roblox automatically if not detected
+ will quit if anything fails (`-e` host shell flag)
+ kill wineprefix via `-k` flag
+ delete all of it's resources via `-d` flag
+ install + launch fps unlocker via `-f` flag
+ will {take environment flags,source} from configuration file `~/.config/rwsh/env`
  + fps unlocker is automatically launched with env `RWSH_FPSUNLOCKER_ENABLE` set to true
  + interchangable specified wine location via `WINEPATH`
