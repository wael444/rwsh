# Impractical Roblox on Linux Installer - IRLI
### why you shouldn't use this
+ [grapejuice](https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice) is literally better
+ you can't use this on a browser
+ only roblox app version (-a)
+ you can't use anything other than DXVK unless you removed it manually
+ it is completely and utterly useless and is only a showcase of my skill issue and brain damage
### why you should use this
+ it works
+ it probably is easier to modify unlike [grapejuice](https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice)
+ if you want the app part of roblox only
+ please don't use this.
